  description:
   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mThe truth is, there’s a time and a place for whole-wheat pasta. Its nutty, earthy flavor isn’t the best match with a light tomato sauce, but it works quite well with bolder ingredients like capers and anchovies, which can stand up to the pasta’s wholesomeness. Hearty vegetables pair well, too. Here, broccoli is cooked down and transformed into an extra-chunky, extra savory sauce. For even more texture, grated cheese is swapped for toasted bread crumbs. In Italy, they’re known as pan grattato, or “grated bread,” as peasants once used them as a cheese replacement on their pasta because they couldn’t afford the real deal. Nowadays both are easily within reach, but the crunch they add here makes it easy to leave the Parmesan behind. You can also make this pasta with cauliflower instead of broccoli. It will be a bit less colorful but equally as flavorful and feel-good.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,

Yvonne Button of Jacksonville, Florida, writes, [1;35m\"[0m[31mAll I want is a very good, basic recipe for deviled eggs. At many gatherings, I've noticed that the deviled eggs disappear much more quickly than the fancy hors d'oeuvres.[1;35m\"[0m[31m This recipe is the answer.[1;35m\n[0m[31m  [1;35m\n[0m[31mThe recipe is so simple that each ingredient really matters. The paprika will determine the depth of flavor of each bite. You can garnish with any kind (hot or sweet Hungarian, or hot or sweet smoked), but the better the quality, the more complex the flavor will be. If your paprika has been sitting on the shelf for years, it's time to get a new bottle.[1;35m\n[0m[31m  [1;35m\n[0m[31mIf you do want to get fancy with the garnishes, feel free to add pickled shallots and fresh herbs, crumbled bacon, or even trout roe. Or you can mix a little hot sauce, harissa, or canned chipotle into the filling for heat, or chopped pickles for tang.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mThe best deviled egg recipe is a classic from Gourmet. Yvonne Button of Jacksonville, Florida, writes, [1;35m\"[0m[31mAll I want is a very good, basic recipe for deviled eggs. At many gatherings, I've noticed that the deviled eggs disappear much more quickly than the fancy hors d'oeuvres.[1;35m\"[0m[31m This recipe is the answer.[1;35m\n[0m[31m  [1;35m\n[0m[31mThe recipe is so simple that each ingredient really matters. The paprika will determine the depth of flavor of each bite. You can garnish with any kind (hot or sweet Hungarian, or hot or sweet smoked), but the better the quality, the more complex the flavor will be. If your paprika has been sitting on the shelf for years, it's time to get a new bottle.[1;35m\n[0m[31m  [1;35m\n[0m[31mIf you do want to get fancy with the garnishes, feel free to add pickled shallots and fresh herbs, crumbled bacon, or even trout roe. Or you can mix a little hot sauce, harissa, or canned chipotle into the filling for heat, or chopped pickles for tang.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,

  description:
   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mIn Mexico, the most commonly offered vegetarian taco at taquerias is the taco de champiñon, or mushroom taco. This recipe lets mushrooms shine, turning them crispy and meaty, almost like carnitas—for even juicier, less crisp mushrooms, feel free to remove them from the heat a few minutes earlier than directed below. I top the pulled mushrooms with a creamy, savory salsa that has been passed down from my great-grandmother to my mother, with a nutty twist that cools the heat of serrano chiles. Read more about the mushroom technique here.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,

  description:
   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mSome things—eye color, certain talents, traditions, recipes—are inherited from generation to generation. Some things aren’t. For example, I didn’t inherit the love for spicy foods that my mother, Alejandra, has—the woman can eat whole jalapeños the way I scarf down popcorn. Nor did I inherit very many recipes: The only one I know of is this salsa. My paternal great-grandmother, Guillermina, or Guille, taught my mom how to make this salsa shortly after my parents married. It boasts no tomato, tomatillo, or citrus; instead, it’s creamy, earthy, and savory, with a little bite. Because my mom lives for heat, she made it spicy, leaving the seeds from the chile intact, but added an eccentric nutty twist—peanut butter—that tames the bite. But I’ve come along and seeded the serrano chiles, to highlight their flavor without the distraction of the heat and, truthfully, to cater to my sensitive tongue.[1;35m\n[0m[31m  [1;35m\n[0m[31mThis savory salsa is the perfect addition to sizzling mushrooms, quesadillas, or nachos. You can dip bread or chips into it, and it’s exceptional with whatever meaty dishes your heart desires.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,
